              <p>Written in <Link href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx">JSX</Link>, all React views are built by composing React components.</p>
              <p>This allows us to easily reuse code throughout our application.</p>

            <Details summary="Declarative API">
              <p>Instead of manipulating the UI <Link href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming'>imperatively</Link> on user interaction, in React we <q>describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input</q> <small><Link href='https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state'>[ref].</Link> </small></p>
              <p className='pt-3'>This allows us to model our UI as a state machine with user interaction causing state transitions. How a UI should change is abstracted to React's diffing and reconcilliation algorithms</p>

            <Details summary="Unidirectional data flow">
              <p>Data flows from parent components to their children. </p>
              Makes debugging simple since all you have to do is go up the component tree until you find where the problem data is coming from.

            <Details summary="Virtual DOM">
              <p>In a similar process to how our UBI software update works, React keeps a desired state of the UI and on deltas between the desired state and actual state(through React's <Link href='https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#the-diffing-algorithm'>diffing algorithm</Link>) will update the minimal required browser DOM nodes to match the desired DOM state.</p>
              <p className='pt-3'>This process of reconcilliation is much faster than tearing down and rebuilding the entire UI on every re-render and abstracts this complexity away from the developer so that we can go ðŸš€<i><strong>FAST</strong></i>ðŸš€</p>

            </Details>        <p className="text-lg font-bold">What is state?</p>
        <p>- State is a component's memory</p>
        <p>- State is not stored within the component but privately inside React allowing it to be kept between renders.</p>
        <p>- State is isolated to particular component instance (a position on the screen. More on that later)</p>
        <p>- When used inside components, state behaves like a snapshot at the point in time of rendering.</p>
        <p>- State is immutable (and we must always treat it this way)</p>
        <p>- Setting state triggers renders</p>
